# Dealership

## Description of the Project

This Java console application simulates a dealership management system, allowing users to browse available vehicles, search by various criteria (such as price, make/model, and mileage), and manage the dealership inventory by adding or removing vehicles. Users can interact with a menu-driven interface to easily view and filter vehicles or modify the inventory.

## User Stories

The following user stories guided the development of this application:

- **As a customer**, I want to view all available vehicles to see the inventory and select a potential purchase.
- **As a customer**, I want to search for vehicles based on price, make/model, year, color, mileage, and type so that I can find the vehicle that best meets my needs.
- **As a user**, I want to add/remove new vehicles to the inventory so that customers have up-to-date options.
